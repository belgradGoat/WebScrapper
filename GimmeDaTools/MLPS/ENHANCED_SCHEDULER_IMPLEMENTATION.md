## 🔧 FINAL INTEGRATION STEPS

### 1. Module Registration (Required)
The enhanced services need to be registered in the module system:

```python
# In core_modules/services/scheduler_service_module.py
def get_provided_services(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "scheduler_service": self.scheduler_service,
        "booking_service": self.scheduler_service.get_booking_service(),
        "locking_service": self.scheduler_service.get_locking_service(),
        "time_granularity_manager": self.scheduler_service.get_time_granularity_manager()
    }
```

### 2. Database Initialization
Create initial JSON files for new data:
```bash
touch machine_bookings.json activity_types.json scheduler_locks.json workpiece_priorities.json
```

### 3. Configuration Updates
Add new settings to [`config.json`](config.json):
```json
{
  "scheduler": {
    "default_granularity": "1hr",
    "enable_booking_conflicts": true,
    "auto_resolve_conflicts": false,
    "default_polling_interval": 10
  }
}
```
