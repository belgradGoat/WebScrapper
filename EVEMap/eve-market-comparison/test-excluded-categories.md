# Testing Excluded Categories Feature

## What Was Implemented

1. **Source-level Exclusion**: Categories are now excluded at the API call level, not as post-processing filters
2. **Pre-filtering for Type IDs**: When specific type IDs are provided, they are filtered before making ESI API calls
3. **General Market Data Filtering**: When downloading all market data, orders from excluded categories are filtered out
4. **Performance Improvement**: Excluded categories are completely removed from the download process

## How to Test

1. **Open the application** at http://localhost:8085
2. **Add excluded categories**:
   - Look for the "Excluded Categories" section in the filter panel
   - Select a category from the dropdown (e.g., "Blueprints" or "Ship Equipment") 
   - Click "Add" to exclude it
3. **Run a market comparison**:
   - Enter buy and sell location IDs
   - Click "Compare Markets"
   - Check the browser console for filtering messages
4. **Verify exclusion**:
   - Look for console messages like: `‚úÖ Excluded category filtering: X -> Y type IDs (Z excluded)`
   - Verify that items from excluded categories don't appear in results

## Key Changes Made

### In `eve-market-api.js`:
- Added pre-filtering logic in `getMarketOrders()` method
- Filters type IDs before making API calls when `options.typeIds` is provided
- Filters downloaded orders when no specific type IDs are given
- Enhanced console logging with emoji indicators

### In `market-comparison.js`:
- Removed post-processing exclusion logic from `compareMarkets()`
- Exclusions now happen at the data source level

## Expected Behavior

- **Before**: All market data was downloaded, then filtered afterwards
- **After**: Excluded categories are never downloaded in the first place
- **Performance**: Significant improvement for large market comparisons
- **Results**: Items from excluded categories should not appear in search results

## Console Messages to Look For

- `üîç Applying excluded category filtering to downloaded orders: [categoryIds]`
- `‚úÖ Excluded category filtering: X orders ‚Üí Y orders (Z excluded)`
- `üö´ Excluding order for ItemName (type X) from category Y`
- `‚ö†Ô∏è All type IDs were excluded by category filters, returning empty result`

## Test Cases

1. **Empty exclusion list**: Normal behavior, no filtering
2. **Single category excluded**: Items from that category should not appear
3. **Multiple categories excluded**: Items from any excluded category should not appear
4. **All categories excluded**: Should return empty results or show appropriate message
5. **Persistence**: Excluded categories should persist between sessions

## Troubleshooting

If exclusions don't seem to work:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify excluded categories are saved in localStorage
3. Check network requests to ensure fewer API calls are made
4. Verify that `window.marketFilters.excludedCategoryIds` contains expected values
